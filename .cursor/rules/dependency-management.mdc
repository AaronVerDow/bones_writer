# Python Dependency Management

## Source of Truth
[flake.nix](mdc:flake.nix) is the authoritative source for Python dependencies in this project. Any changes to Python package requirements must be made in `flake.nix` first.

## Synchronization Requirements
[requirements.txt](mdc:requirements.txt) must be kept in sync with the Python packages specified in `flake.nix`. When changes are made to Python dependencies in `flake.nix`, the following rules apply:

1. All Python packages listed in `flake.nix` must be reflected in `requirements.txt`
2. Version constraints in `requirements.txt` should be preserved when they exist
3. New packages added to `flake.nix` should be added to `requirements.txt` without version constraints unless specifically required

## Development Workflow
When adding or modifying Python dependencies:
1. Update the dependencies in `flake.nix` first
2. Synchronize the changes to `requirements.txt`
3. Test the development environment to ensure all dependencies are properly installed

This ensures consistency between the Nix development environment and pip-based installations.
